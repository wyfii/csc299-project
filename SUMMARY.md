## Building It Six Times

I ended up having to make a task manager six different times for this project, which sounded ridiculous at first. I honestly thought it was just busy work, but it really ended up being the thing that made everything click. Every version forced me to relearn what I just did in a cleaner or more structured way, which helped me to see that I'm improving instead of just doing one big project and hoping for the best.

## How I Used AI

The first version was rough; I was basically just trying to make something that didn't crash. My code structure was a mess, and I didn't really understand testing yet. But that's where AI came in for me. I used AI the whole semester, mainly Claude, and sometimes ChatGPT if I wanted a second explanation. I didn't use it to copy entire solutions. I mostly used it when I was stuck on something specific, such as why my JSON wasn't saving, or why Python kept yelling at me about imports. AI was sort of like having a tutor who didn't get tired of my dumb questions.

## Learning Not to Trust AI Blindly

Pretty quickly, I learned you can't trust every answer AI gives you. In Task 1, Claude gave me an ID-generation idea that looked cool, so I used it without really understanding it. Huge mistake. Of course, it broke and I couldn't fix it because I didn't know even how it works. That was the moment when I realized that I really can't use AI like a cheat code. If I don't understand the code, then it is pretty much useless for me. From then on, I forced myself to at least read everything before adding it.

## Progress Through Each Task

By Task 2, I finally understood why testing mattered. At first, writing tests was just annoying, but my tests caught so many little bugs that it honestly saved me hours. Then in Task 3, when we had to make it a real Python package, AI helped me understand modules and imports because I had no idea what I was doing. That's where AI was at its best—explaining things in a way I could actually understand at 1am.

Task 4 was wild because I used AI to help me add AI to the project. I learned how to call APIs, store keys safely, and, most importantly, why you should never hard-code secrets, even in a school project. Task 5 slowed me down because I had to plan it out, but once I did start coding it, I realized that doing the planning first actually makes the whole thing at least ten times easier.

## The Final Version

The final version is the first time in this class where I feel like I built something real. I split everything into modules, wrote a bunch of tests, colored the CLI, and finally had a version that didn't feel like a school assignment but rather something I would show someone.

## What I Actually Learned

The biggest thing I learned was how to use AI responsibly. AI can explain, help debug, and give examples- but it can't replace understanding. I wrote the code - AI just helped me learn faster. And honestly, doing this project six times is what made everything finally click.
